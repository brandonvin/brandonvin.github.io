## Thank you, Chad!

Chad Baldwin made an excellent
[blog post](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)
about how to start a blog using GitHub pages.

I stumbled upon that today and thought dang, that looks
like something I can try in about 15 minutes... let me go make a cup of tea.
And here it is!

Thank you, Chad.

More coming soon.
