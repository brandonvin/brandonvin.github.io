## Hey! I'm Brandon Vincent.

Welcome to my mind map.

I was born and raised in [Western Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Washington), and
I'm still here, though a lot has changed -- most recently,
I've got engaged to my beautiful wife-to-be, Kim Hua,
and settled into a home with our cat, Mr. Whiskers.


A few fun facts about me:

* I love languages and linguistics. I was raised bilingual in English and
  American Sign Language. Then I learned Spanish and Russian to a
  conversational level. Some day, I'll speak Vietnamese. Some day...

* I play bass with a local band, [Montlake Traffic](https://linktr.ee/montlaketraffic). There's
  a ton of great local music in Seattle.

* In my "free time" (does that even exist?) I enjoy hiking and getting outside around the PNW
  and traveling to interesting places.

Thanks for stopping by! 

What kind of trees are growing around here? Let's go for a walk...
